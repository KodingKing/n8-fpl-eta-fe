# Fantasy Portfolio League - React App

## Introduction 
### Status Quo
The retail participation in Indian stock markets is rising. A SBI report, pointing out that 44.7 lakh retails investor accounts have been added during the two months of the initial lockdown due to pandemic .The number of individual investors in the market has increased by 142 lakh in FY21, with 122.5 lakh new accounts at CDSL and 19.7 lakh in NSDL. Also, the share of individual investors in total turnover on the stock exchange has risen to 45% from 39% in Marâ€™20, as shown by NSE data.

We believe the reason for the jump in the numbers has been due to increased household savings, generated due to the pandemic that the new investors are putting into stocks.

Further we believe that we have a huge untapped potential for introducing the young age population to Investing in Indian Companies. These too serve as our idea users to learn and grow using our platform.

### Product Opportunity
